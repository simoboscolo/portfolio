		<h3>Breif introduction to Lasagne</h3>
		<p>Well, there are many things you need to do to have a decent lasagna, in the italian way. Like there was any other way...</p>
		<p>First you need to know the basic. To develope (yes i said it was like coding) a pretty decent lasagna you need to know it's made from layers.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lasagna Pasta Slices stuffs (i have no idea what the official term is).</li>
			<li>Besciamel</li>
			<li>Ragu (what atheist call bolognese and no italian knows why)</li>
			<li>Plenty of parmesan</li>
			<li>A bit of fairy dust</li>
		</ul>		
		<p>Once you get this you're ready to make the most amazing Lasagna any italian grandma has aver seen.</p>
		<p>So let's start with all the ingredients for the different layers and how to prepare all this stuffs</p>
	</div>
	<div class="ingredients">	
		<h2>Ragu</h2>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One carrot</li>
			<li>Two onions</li>
			<li>250g grounded beef</li>
			<li>Some pork sausages with some fancy spices in it. It's gonna give the extra taste nobody knows where from</li>
			<li>Tomato puree</li>
			<li>Concentred Tomato Puree</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Black pepper</li>
			<li>Sugar (you were not expecting this one, where you?)</li>
			<li>Olive oil</li>
			<li>Red Wine (so many surprises in here)</li>
			<li>Garlic</li>
	</div>

		</ul>
		<p>Sooooo!! Let's get to it! First of all chop onions and the carrots as you like. I like small cubes but it's up to you really. Clean one or two garlic cloves. Then thake a big pan and put some olive oil. When it's warm enough trow in all the onion and carrots and the two garlic cloves. I don't like a strong taste of garlic so at the end of the preparation I remove them. Here if you like garlic just press it in a paste and leave it in. When the onion will be getting a bit crunchy put all the amazing grounded meat. Open the sausages and take out the meat and mix it with the beef. When it will start to cook take two glasses of red wine. Put one in the pan and drink the other one. The wine will start boiling and give a very good fragrance so enjoy it. When is drying a bit and you feel the meat need some moist put the tomato puree and leave it there. Turn everything sometimes so it doesn't get stuck to the pan. Add salt and black pepper and a pinch of sugar. Why sugar? It corrects the acidity of the tomato. Put also the concentred tomato puree to give more taste to the hole stuff, tasteit and fix spices as you prefer. Leave it to cook for a while it will taste better and better the more it cooks on slow fire.</p>
		<p><strong>PRO TIP!</strong> I like to put also mushrooms inside so if you like them, put some after the onion and before the meat.</p>

		<h2>Besciamel</h2>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1l of Milk</li>
			<li>Nutmeg</li>
			<li>A lot of butter (like officially 100g but i always put more, because butter is great, like DIVs.)</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Black Pepper</li>
			<li>80g of flour</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Besciamel it's the glue of lasagna. And it's great! I mean you can buy it in Albert Heijn but it sucks so we are gonna make it ourselfs. I remember my father used to ask me and my siblings to try the besciamel and check if the taste was alright and we were like: uhm... pepper it's ok... *another spoon* Milks is ok... *another spoon* Nutmeg also ok... Basically it was amazing and we where double checking everything just to eat more. Anyway. Put the butter in a big pan and melt it. slowly put the flour and mix it with a whisk so that it won't lump. When it looks like heaven put slowly the milk and keep mixing. Put salt and Pepper and a bit of nutmeg and keep it mixing on slow fire for like 15 minutes. It should be creamy if it's not, well put more flour or milk or butter. I mean taste it and see what's wrong with it. You can fix it!</p>

		<h2>Let's make some layers</h2>
		<p>Now you need to put your shit together! Start to turn on the hoven at 180. And here a special trick from my papa. Boil a bit of water, take the lasagna pasta and put it in till it gets a bit soft, like 1 min is enough. this will allow the pasta to absorb all the taste so it will make your lasagna special (it's your fairy dust extra). Take an hoven pan and make a layer of lasgna pasta, put a lot of ragu, a lot of besciamel, and a new layer of lasgna pasta. Go on for a few layers, and when you think we're there then the top part will be again meat, besciamel and something like 3 kg of parmesan on top. Put it in the oven till the parmesen get's brown and crunchy and tadaaaaan! You've got an AMAZING lasagna!</p>
